1.React
 1)Declarative
 
React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, 
and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug           


 2)Component-Based
Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.  

			 
	3)Learn Once, Write Anywhere
We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.
React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native


2.Angular JS

AngularJS lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser. It lets you use good old HTML (or HAML, Jade/Pug and friends!) as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express your application’s components clearly and succinctly. It automatically synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data binding. To help you structure your application better and make it easy to test, AngularJS teaches the browser how to do dependency injection and inversion of control.

It also helps with server-side communication, taming async callbacks with promises and deferred objects, and it makes client-side navigation and deep linking with hashbang urls or HTML5 pushState a piece of cake. Best of all? It makes development fun!

3.BABEL

Babel is a community-driven tool that helps you write code in the latest version of JavaScript.
When your supported environments don't support certain features natively, Babel will help you compile those features down to a supported version.
